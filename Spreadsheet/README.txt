Design Decisions
Wanted this spreadsheet to be intuitive. Maneuvering throughout the cells can easily be done through
either mouse clicks or by using the arrow key. When it came time to computing formulas, we didn't want to 
burden the aesthetic with weird compute buttons - instead we just added the compute functionality to enterKey 
presses. The menu system is simple and compact, and rather than simply add a close element within our menu system,
we decided to build that functionality into the normal "X" button that a user would typically use to close the program.
For additional functionality, we wanted to be able to view the file we were currently working with, especially considering
the potential for many windows being open. We wanted to make sure each file/window was easily identifiable.


Visual Decisions
Added some coloring the the columns and rows to create more interest and pop,
rather than use a bland form. We also made sure the text boxes and other menu items and elements
in the top menu follow a fair design pattern.
