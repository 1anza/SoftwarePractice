Design Decisions
We wanted to try to make it look and act as close to Kopta's version as possible. We inluded the similar looking beam 
animations as well as powerup and explosion drawers. As for functionality, we felt it would be more
effiecient to have the projectile fire on the space bar when using a laptop. The rest of the controls are the 
same as the original, including the beam fire on right mouse click.

Visual Aspects
We liked the look of the beams and explosions when drawn in the view, so we maintained that cohesiveness.
However, we did want to stand apart from the vanilla version. We decided a fun way to do this would be to make the projectiles randomly colorful - 
causing a real rainbow of a battle when one starts.
